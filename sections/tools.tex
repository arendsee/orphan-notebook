\section{Tools}

\subsection{Genome Alignment}

\subsubsection{Satsuma}

The Satsuma genome alignment tool: \cite{grabherr2010genome}. Based on 3 ideas:
1) \textbf{cross-correlation}, a FFT algorithm borrowed from audio-processing,
to find sequence matches, 2) battleship algorithm for perforance, 3) synteny
filter.

\subsubsection{MUMmer4}

The MUMmer4 genome alignment tool: \cite{marccais2018mummer4}.

\textbf{Method}: suffix-tree

\subsection{BLAST}

\subsection{HMMBlits}

\subsection{GeneWise}

\subsection{RepeatMasker}

\subsection{bedtools}

  Tool for genome arithmetic and set analyses.

\subsection{Genome simulation}

  Two recent studies on the power of BLAST were based on gene simulations
  \cite{moyers_phylostratigraphic_2015,moyers_evaluating_2016}, however these
  simulated genes alone. If gene context is included, more sophisticated
  methods are required.

  A very cool class of simulators are the phylo-grammar based programs built by
  Ian Holmes \cite{klosterman_xrate:_2006}. 

  This approach was further developed \cite{westesson_developing_2012}.
