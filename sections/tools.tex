\subsection{Genome simulation}

Two recent studies on the power of BLAST were based on gene simulations
\cite{moyers_phylostratigraphic_2015,moyers_evaluating_2016}, however these
simulated genes alone. If gene context is included, more sophisticated methods
are required.

A very cool class of simulators are the phylo-grammar based programs built by
Ian Holmes \cite{klosterman_xrate:_2006}. 

This approach was further developed \cite{westesson_developing_2012}.
