\subsection{False orphans}

\subsubsection{AT3G53370.2 - splicing artifact}

AT3G53370.2 is classified as an orphan according to blastp (threshold 1e-5).
However the model AT3G53370.1 is classified as Embryophyta-specific.

\begin{verbatim}
 >AT3G53370.2
 MDGEDFAG                                        KNLPPRKKKPVSKKKLKREKLKQGVPVPGE
 >AT3G53370.1
 MDGEDFAG KAAAEAKGLNPGLIVLLVVGGPLLVFLIANYVLYVYAQ KNLPPRKKKPVSKKKLKREKLKQGVPVPGE
\end{verbatim}

HMM-based methods are sensative enough to detect the similarity, however.
HHBlits and HMMER easily detect its similarity to other S1FA DNA binding
domains.
