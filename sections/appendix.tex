\subsection{Reproducibile research}

    There was a recent series in nature about the repoducibility issues faced
    in science
    (\href{http://www.nature.com/news/reproducibility-1.17552}{here}).

    A review on the lack of reproducibility of p-values
    \cite{halsey2015fickle}. P-values are a random variables. We would never
    report a single measurement without a standard deviation. Similarly we
    should not report p-values without mentioning the power of the study.
